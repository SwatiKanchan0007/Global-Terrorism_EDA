# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Terrorism Worldwide and in India

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries to showcase the gradual trend of terrorism both globally and specifically in India.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the patterns and trends of terrorism over time. By visualizing the data, we aim to identify significant changes and highlight specific regions or countries affected by terrorism.

### Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The raw GTD data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values, inconsistent entries, and irrelevant columns are handled to ensure accurate insights.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Utilizing Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, we analyze the dataset to showcase trends, patterns, and distributions of terrorist activities over time.

### Key Visualizations
1. Time Series Plot: Displaying the trend of terrorist activities worldwide, highlighting the increase or decrease in attacks over the years.

2. Geographical Heatmap: Visualizing the distribution of terrorist attacks across different countries, with a focus on India, to identify regions most affected by terrorism.

### Insights and Impact
Through this EDA, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of global terrorism trends, with a specific focus on India. The insights gained will aid policymakers, security agencies, and other stakeholders in formulating strategies to combat terrorism effectively. Additionally, this analysis can contribute to the development of targeted policies and measures to enhance security and minimize the impact of terrorist activities in high-risk regions.
